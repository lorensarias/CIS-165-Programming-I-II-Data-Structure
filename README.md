# CIS-165-Programming-I-II-Data-Structure
This repository will contain the Projects done in CIS-160, CSI-161 and CSI-165. ( Programing I , Programming II and Data Structure in C++) 

- **CIS 160 -** Covers the Basic in C++, Math operations, If Statements , loops , functions and more.
- **CIS 161 -** Covers Extensive programming activities utilizing structures, arrays, classes, files, and pointers are covered. Efficient searching and sorting techniques, effective use of dynamic memory allocation, pointer arithmetic, and recursive functions are also covered. In addition, stacks, queue, and linked list structures. 
- **CIS 165** - Implementation of Abstract Data Types (ADTâ€™s) and techniques of object-oriented analysis and design. Recursive methods and solutions for data structures including linked lists, stacks, queues, graphs, and trees are covered. In addition, various searching methods, sorting methods, and memory management techniques are covered.
